# RShinyEMAlgoirthm_ComputationalProbability
In Computational Probability class the class was instructed to get in groups of 3 and create an RShiny app that effectively runs an EM Algorithm. My group (Henrique Dos Reis, Ross Bravo, and I) worked together to build our app where we focused a lot of attention on the end user side to make our app stand out.

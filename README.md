# RShinyEMAlgoirthm_ComputationalProbability

Date: November 2023 - December 2023

Keywords: Statistics, Data Analysis, RStudio, RShiny

Description:
In Computational Probability class the class was instructed to get in groups of 3 and create an RShiny app that effectively runs an EM Algorithm. My group (Henrique Dos Reis, Ross Bravo, and I) worked together to build our app where we focused a lot of attention on the end user side to make our app stand out. 

Assignment Criteria:
- Replicate the professor EM Algorithm app: https://mehdi-m.shinyapps.io/EM-Algorithm/
- Create a 20-minute presentation highlighting what choices you made when it comes to your EM algorithm

Contents:
- Presentation
- App: Code to RShiny app
